# Python_Optimization
In this exaple I have used Stirling numbers in three forms of coding. The first one is pure Python. The second one is optimization, using cython. The third one is optimization with specified data types.

## Results

Function|Time
---|---
stirling|709 µs +- 112 µs per loop
stirling2|275 µs +- 32.3 µs per loop
stirling3|240 µs +- 23.2 µs per loop
